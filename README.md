# Pupstr

## Description
We've all been on Tinder, or Bumble, or another dating app, where we'd be wishing that we were scrolling through photos of dogs instead of photos of people. That's why we've made Pupstr.

## Usage 
Pupstr is a React app deployed on Heroku, so all you need to do to use it is go on to the Heroku live site. Which I'd link, if I knew what it was. Sorry! Once you're there, you should be redirected to the lovely home page. Click on the Discover tab to get to the Discover page to start seeing some cool random dog pics! If you like the dog you see, hit the "thumbs up" button, and there'll be a 20% chance of the dog liking you back! Hit the Search tab to get to the Search page to search for a dog breed, and you'll see a set of random pics of that breed of dog! All the pupstrs are here, on pupstr.
